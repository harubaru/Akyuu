For this command, there are tons of ways to help customize the experience. Each option here will be used to help tailor how the text is generated. Most are optional, so you don't have to completely fill everything out!

3. **Start typing out some actions.**

All of your stories are saved automatically, so don't worry about not being able to come back where you last left off.

### Common Questions

- The AI gave me something strange! How do I undo or retry the last action?

Actions can be undoed with ``/stories undo`` or even retried with ``/stories retry``

- How do I get the AI to just continue the story by itself?

Interested in continuing the text without any input? Just type in ``/stories continue`` and the AI will automatically pick up where you left off.

- Can I edit the last action manually?

Of course! Simply type in ``/stories alter`` to replace the last action with your own text.

- How do I view the current story?

Simply type in ``/stories view`` to view the story!

### Privacy

Want to delete everything including your stories? You can delete all of the information stored on the bot by running ``/accounts delete`` and typing ``DELETE`` as a confirmation.

### Additional Features

- Author's Note

The Author's note is used to add a subtle change to the style or even to guide the AI into generating what you want.

- Memory

The Memory is used to manually store the events in your story. Currently, this is not changed automatically, so this must be done manually!
